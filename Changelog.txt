Version 0.1.3 - April 10, 2016
------------------------------
You now receive ten empty blueprints when uplinked, so you can remotely direct your construction robots.
The Blueprint String mod (https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?t=13651) will let you import your blueprints into these empty ones, and save them if you make new blueprints;
remember that blueprints you make while uplinked will be destroyed when you terminate the uplink.
Fixed Russian translation encoding issue.
Officially changed to the MIT License.
Officially changed the mod-folder name to "Satellite Uplink Sation" as opposed to just "Uplink Station".
The mod is now using the Factorio Standard Library (https://github.com/Afforess/Factorio-Stdlib/wiki).
Fixed a rare crash when the uplink station was destroyed and the player's character killed while they were uplinked.

It is now no longer possible to remove the dummy armor that is automatically given to the uplink-character, nor the equipment within.
It is now no longer possible to use the logistics system while uplinked to request items -- any items that bots do bring to you will be destroyed.


Version 1.0.1 - August 18, 2016
-------------------------------
Any blueprint books you have in your possession upon entering the uplink station will now be copied over so you can use them while uplinked!

You are now not pushed around by belts while uplinked.
The performance-hungry copying of all blueprint books has been removed, because 0.15's new Blueprint Library feature now allows you to access any of your blueprints while uplinked.
